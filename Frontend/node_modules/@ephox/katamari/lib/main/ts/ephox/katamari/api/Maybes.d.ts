/**
 The `Maybe` type represents a value (of any type) that potentially does not
 exist. Any `Maybe<T>` can either be a `Just<T>` (in which case the value does
 exist, and can be accessed as `.value`) or a `Nothing` (in which case the
 value does not exist). This file defines a whole lot of FP-inspired utility
 functions for dealing with Maybe objects. Things to note:
 1. Functions are grouped based on, primarily, their Haskell roots. That
 said, I'm not a Haskell programmer so it might be imperfect.
 2. Many of the functions are "curried". This means that they take all of
 their arguments that are not the Maybe object first, and then they return a
 function that takes the Maybe object and actually performs the operation.
 This is done to make the functions easier to use with Fun.pipe, so that code
 can be written left to right.

 Comparison with null or undefined
 - We don't get fancy null coalescing operators with Maybe
 - We do get fancy helper functions with Maybe
 - Maybes support nesting, and allow for the type to still be nullable (or
 another Maybe)
 - There is no option to turn off strict-maybe-checks like there is for
 strict-null-checks
 - Try to use Maybe instead of null or undefined where you can

 Comparison with Optional
 - Optional uses a.method().method(), Maybe uses Fun.pipe(a, method(), method())
 - Optional is invariant, Maybe is covariant (Maybe<Dog> counts as a
 Maybe<Animal> but Optional<Dog> does not count as Optional<Animal>)
 - Maybe tree-shakes and minifies a lot better
 - Maybe can be `console.log`ed
 - Maybe might perform better because it doesn't need to create messy objects
 - Optional is deprecated (but still in very wide use) and you should try to
 migrate over to Maybe where you can

 WARNING:
 1. You should only be using this function if you know that the Maybe object

 which is bad).
 2. If you know that the Maybe object is not empty, then TypeScript should
 also know that the Maybe object is not empty (comparison operations on `.tag`
 as well as the `isJust` method will both allow the compiler to infer that the
 object is not empty).
 3. If TypeScript knows that the Maybe object is not empty, it will let you
 just access `.value` directly, without needing this function + without
 risking an exception being thrown.

 Therefore, you should only be calling this function in environments where
 you're unable to completely type-check your code (IE: tests). In all other
 situations, **avoid this method**.
